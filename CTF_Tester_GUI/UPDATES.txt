Connect the buzzer to 0v and the CTF\Arduino will provide +5v (then back to 0v) and then high
Add a line to from the buzzer to INPUT_PIN on arduino(line sniff on buzz +5v), and read the voltage 
      0 = failed
      1 = success
Also throw a line to A0 and read analog 
Add debug/log info to tell which pin(s) arent working
Figure out what time will work the best, i.e to go pin-to-pin
Figure out a way to probe around to find the first pin
Add another output and test switching from both 
Add 2n2222s ;) 
Each trace is isolated and no shorts
